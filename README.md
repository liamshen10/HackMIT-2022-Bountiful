Title Page

Bountiful is a game that encourages generosity, thoughtful thinking, and cooperation featuring the "bounty" system, an extensible game framework incentivizing active game development and donations to local charities.

*Players can utilize in-game virtual currency to fund projects -Active polling for new features

*Once a project is successfully funded in-game, new content is added to the game and a donation is made to charities of the players’ choice -Partnerships with charities in the Boston community, US, worldwide, etc.

*Currency earned through simply playing the game, interacting with players -Currency cap incentivizes players to cooperate with each other -Additional benefits by doing tasks together

The “Bounty” System: -A poll is set for possible features to be added to the game -Once a winner is decided, a goal is made for players to reach in order for feature to be added -Along with a feature, users vote for which charity a donation will be made to -Multiple tiers of rewards depending on player performance

*For Bountiful, features can range from player trading, decorations, new game modes, and new levels to voice chat and personal lobbies

*Similar in concept/design to Kickstarter’s stretch goal system
